# Designer

Short README for the `Designer` workspace.

**Project Overview**

- `Designer` is a small Python workspace containing utilities and experiments. The repository currently contains two scripts: `gpu_diagnostic.py` and `tst1.py`.

**Purpose**

- Provide quick diagnostics and small test scripts used during development. The code is exploratory and may be updated frequently.

**Repository Structure**

- `gpu_diagnostic.py`: GPU-related diagnostic utilities or checks.
- `tst1.py`: Small test or example script.
- `README.md`: This file.

**Requirements**

- Python 3.8 or newer. There is no `requirements.txt` included by default — add one if external dependencies are required.

**Quick Start (Windows PowerShell)**

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Run a script (example):

```
python gpu_diagnostic.py
```

Or run the test/example script:

```
python tst1.py
```

**Testing**

- There are no automated tests configured. Add a `tests/` folder with test cases and a `requirements.txt` if you want CI or test runners.

**Contributing**

- Fork and create a branch for changes. Open a pull request describing the intent and any manual test steps.

**Author**

- Ahmed Hossam

**License**

- No license file is included. Add a `LICENSE` if you want to declare terms for reuse.

If you want, I can: add a `requirements.txt`, create a basic test harness, or add more detailed usage notes for `gpu_diagnostic.py`. Tell me which next step you prefer.
