      "slide title": "The Core Architectural Pillars",
      "slide content": "• **The Brain (LLM):** Acts as the central reasoning engine for decision-making.\n• **Planning:** Utilizing techniques like ReAct or Tree-of-Thoughts to strategize.\n• **Memory:** Short-term (context window) and long-term (vector databases) storage.\n• **Tools:** The 'hands' of the agent, including APIs, browsers, and terminal access."

      "slide title": "Standard LLMs vs. Agentic Systems",
      "slide content": "**Standard LLM (Chat-Centric):**\n• Requires specific instructions for every step.\n• Limited to the knowledge contained in its training data.\n• Human must verify and manually implement outputs.\n\n**Agentic System (Task-Centric):**\n• Figures out 'how' to do a task given a high-level goal.\n• Fetches real-time data and interacts with third-party software.\n• Self-corrects and iterates until the goal is achieved."

      "slide type": "Bullet point slide",
      "slide title": "Common Reasoning Frameworks",
      "slide content": "• **Chain of Thought (CoT):** Encouraging the model to show its work step-by-step.\n• **Self-Reflection:** The agent critiques its own plan to find flaws before execution.\n• **ReAct (Reason + Act):** Interleaving reasoning traces and task-specific actions.\n• **Plan-and-Solve:** Creating a full roadmap before taking the first action."

      "slide title": "The Power of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)",
      "slide content": "• **Specialization:** Assigning specific roles (e.g., 'Reviewer', 'Coder', 'Manager') to different agents.\n• **Conflict Resolution:** Agents debating different solutions to find the optimal path.\n• **Parallelism:** Handling massive tasks by breaking them into sub-tasks for multiple agents.\n• **Orchestration:** A lead agent coordinating the workflow of subordinate agents."

      "slide title": "Conclusion: Preparing for the Agentic Era",
      "slide content": "The transition to Agentic AI is not just a technical upgrade but an operational one. Organizations must focus on building 'human-in-the-loop' checkpoints to ensure safety while reaping the benefits of 24/7 autonomous productivity. As we move toward a world of digital coworkers, the primary human skill will shift from 'doing the work' to 'orchestrating the agents' that do it."
